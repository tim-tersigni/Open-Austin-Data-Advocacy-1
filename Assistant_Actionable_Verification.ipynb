    "# GPT4 Assistant Actionable Item Analysis\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "The City Auditor's office identified two problematic themes in their report regarding item actionability: \"Specifically, some recommendations contained language that makes it difficult for the recommendation to be implemented as they are not specific, measurable, and actionable. In addition, many recommendations are not currently tracked.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "Can we use the OpenAI assistant API to audit each recommendation looking for language that is not specific, measureable, and actionable?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "- Create an OpenAI assistant that can analyze the dataset.\n",
    "- Instruct the assistant to determine whether each entry contains specific, measurable, and actionable language.\n",
    "- Log the assistant's observations in an updated dataset for further analysis."
